invariant
=========

find posts by criteria:
* must be image post
* probably limit to specific subreddits
* must be > 6 months old
* must have under a certian amount of upvotes (we can't just repost top all the time now can we?)

review posts:
* present list of posts to user for easy review
* this happens weekly? review ~ 14 images?

post:
* one to two images per night
* maybe find a way to leverage reddits peak hours
* can we refactor the title at all?
